# Etch-a-Sketch

### Purpose
The goal of this exercise is to create a web application that functions like a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. This project will showcase the JavaScript I have learned, allowing for dynamic interaction with the DOM. After completing the exercise, I will gain a better understanding of how to interact dynamically using JavaScript and reflect changes on the DOM.

### Objectives
1. Establish a 16x16 grid of square divs.
2. Implement a hovering effect to mimic changing color effects, leaving a trace as the mouse enters and leaves each div.
3. Add a button that prompts the user for the grid size, allowing for dynamic changes to the grid size.

### Requirements
This project is based on the following requirements:

-  Follow the instructions for setting up your projectâ€™s GitHub repository.
-  Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
-  Generate the divs using JavaScript; do not create them manually by copying and pasting in your HTML file!
-  It's best to place your grid squares inside a "container" div, which can be included in your HTML.
-  Use Flexbox to arrange the divs in a grid layout. Avoid using CSS Grid, as it will be taught in a later lesson. This project is an opportunity specifically to practice Flexbox!
